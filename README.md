# Data analysis project (IBM)

I have recently been hired as a Data Analyst by a global IT and business consulting services firm that is known for its expertise in IT solutions and its team of highly experienced IT consultants.  To keep pace with changing technologies and remain competitive, my organization regularly analyzes data to help identify future skill requirements. 

As a Data Analyst, I will be assisting with this initiative and have been tasked with collecting data from various sources and identifying trends for this year's report on emerging skills. 

I will perform the various tasks that professional data analysts do as part of their jobs, including: 
- Data collection from multiple sources 
- Data wrangling and data preparation 
- Exploratory data analysis  to identify insight and trends such as: What are the top programming languages in demand? or, What are the top database skills in demand?
- Statistical analysis and data mining 
- Data visualization with different charts and plots, and 
- Interactive dashboard creation. 

The project will culminate with a presentation of my data analysis report for various stakeholders in the organization. The report will include an executive summary, my analysis, and a conclusion.
